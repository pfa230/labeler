## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: A screen renders the reported inputs and decides nothing else

A screen that collects label data SHALL render exactly the entries the service reports for the label
it is about to submit, using each entry's `control` and seeding it from `default`, and SHALL treat a
label as incomplete exactly when some entry marked `required` has no value. It SHALL NOT inspect the
template's layout, evaluate a `when:` condition, or normalize a value in order to decide any of this.

The print form SHALL render `inputs.default` for its first paint and SHALL then request a list for
the label it would actually submit, including any value it seeded itself, before treating that label
as complete. This matters because the form seeds a `datetime` control from the browser
(`datetime-params`) while `inputs.default` was computed against the service's instant, so across a
date boundary the two can select different branches, and because a `datetime` parameter may be a
`when:` key.

It SHALL request a fresh list when a value changes, debounced, and SHALL keep rendering the previous
list until the new one arrives, so controls do not flicker while the operator types.

A grid is the one screen whose columns and whose controls are not the same set. Its **columns** are
the union of the names across the rows present, so the table has a stable shape while rows select
different branches. Its **cells** follow each row's own list: a cell whose name is not in that row's
list SHALL be inert, meaning not editable, not validated, and not submitted for that row. A value the
cell held before the row deactivated the name SHALL be retained and SHALL become editable again when
the name returns to the row's list. That is how a union column and a per-row list coexist without
either rule bending.

A grid cell's **editor** follows that same reported `control`. A cell whose control is `textarea`
SHALL be edited in a control that accepts a line break, and its keys SHALL be: Enter commits the
edit, Shift+Enter inserts a newline, Escape abandons it, and moving focus away commits. Enter SHALL
NOT insert a newline. A grid owns Enter for commit, an operator reaches for it out of habit, and one
that silently broke the line instead would cost a row of typing with no way back. A newline the
operator enters SHALL reach the submitted `data` unaltered.

A cell SHALL show that its value holds a line break rather than rendering it as one collapsed line,
so that a two-line value is distinguishable from the same words written with a space, and so that an
operator can tell the cell holds more than the row has room to show. This applies to every cell whose
value holds a newline, not only to one whose control is `textarea`: a CSV import and a connector both
deliver such a value into a cell the operator never opens.

No screen SHALL treat a label as complete, or allow it to be submitted, while the list for that
label's current values has been requested and not yet received. A stale list would otherwise report
one branch's names as satisfied while the render followed another. The only exception is the failure
path below.

The CSV import grid and the connector grid SHALL request lists for their rows in one request, and
SHALL block a run while any row's list is unresolved. The grid's columns are the union of the names
across the rows present. The template preview fills sample values by the same rule a thumbnail uses, over the same `inputs.all`
set and for the same reason: a sample value is part of the request and can decide a gate, so a set
drawn from `inputs.default` would not cover the branch its own samples activate.

The Connect field-mapping palette SHALL offer the names in `inputs.all`, so a mapping can be built
before any row exists and can target a name only some branch reads.

A value already entered for a name a later list omits SHALL be retained in the screen's own state, so
that reselecting the branch restores it, and SHALL NOT be included in the `data` the screen submits.
A screen SHALL submit exactly the names in its current list.

This is not an optimization. Rendering resolves and coerces every declared parameter before it
evaluates any `when:`, so a value that fails coercion rejects the render whether or not the item that
reads it is active. Submitting a value from a deactivated branch would therefore let a field the
operator can no longer see fail a label the form reports as complete. `docs/SPEC.md` §5's laziness
covers an *omitted* required parameter, not a *supplied* invalid one.

For the same reason a screen SHALL omit, rather than submit as an empty string, a name whose value is
empty and whose control is `integer`, `number`, `select`, `checkbox`, `date` or `datetime`. An empty
value for a `text`, `textarea` or `image` control is a value and SHALL be submitted. Both rules are
decided from `control` alone, so no screen needs the declared type to apply them.

When a request for a list fails, a screen SHALL keep the last list it received, or `inputs.all` when
it has received none, and SHALL surface the failure rather than silently blocking the operator.

#### Scenario: Switching a parameter changes what the print form asks for

- **WHEN** the operator switches `orientation` from `horizontal` to `vertical` on a template whose
  horizontal branch reads `{subtitle}` and whose vertical branch reads `{tracking_url}`
- **THEN** the form stops showing and requiring `subtitle` and starts showing and requiring
  `tracking_url`

#### Scenario: Controls do not flicker while a list is in flight

- **WHEN** the operator types into a field and a new list has been requested but not yet received
- **THEN** the form keeps rendering the previous list

#### Scenario: A preview sample that decides a gate does not strand its own branch

- **WHEN** a template declares `mode` as a required `string`, an unconditional `text` item reads
  `{mode}`, and a container gated on `mode: mode` reads `{subtitle}`
- **THEN** the preview fills both `mode` and `subtitle`, and the preview renders

#### Scenario: A grid cell for a name inactive on its row is inert

- **WHEN** the grid shows a `subtitle` column because one row selects `orientation: horizontal`, and
  another row selects `vertical`, for which `subtitle` is not reported
- **THEN** that row's `subtitle` cell is not editable, is not validated, and is absent from the `data`
  that row submits

#### Scenario: An inert cell keeps its value and comes back

- **WHEN** a row holding a `subtitle` value switches to `orientation: vertical` and then back to
  `horizontal`
- **THEN** the cell is inert in between, and the value is there and editable again afterwards

#### Scenario: A pending list blocks submission

- **WHEN** the operator switches `orientation` from `horizontal` to `vertical` and the list for the
  new values has not yet arrived
- **THEN** the form is not submittable until it does, so no label is sent against the horizontal
  branch's completeness check

#### Scenario: A value survives switching away and back

- **WHEN** the operator enters a value for `subtitle`, switches `orientation` to `vertical`, then
  switches back
- **THEN** the value entered for `subtitle` is still there

#### Scenario: Two grid rows selecting different branches require different inputs

- **WHEN** one import row sets `orientation = horizontal` and another sets `orientation = vertical`
- **THEN** the first row is invalid only for a missing `subtitle` and the second only for a missing
  `tracking_url`, while the grid shows a column for each

#### Scenario: An integer and a number are distinguishable controls

- **WHEN** a template declares `copies` as an `integer` with `min: 1` and `max: 9`, and `scale` as a
  `number` with no bounds
- **THEN** the `copies` entry carries control `integer` with `slider` true, and the `scale` entry
  carries control `number` with `slider` false

#### Scenario: A value from a deactivated branch is not submitted

- **WHEN** the operator enters a value for `subtitle`, then switches `orientation` to `vertical`, and
  the new list omits `subtitle`
- **THEN** the submitted `data` carries no `subtitle`, and the value is still there on switching back

#### Scenario: A cleared numeric field is omitted rather than sent blank

- **WHEN** the operator clears an `integer` control that declares a default
- **THEN** the submitted `data` omits that name, and the label renders with the declared default

#### Scenario: A cleared text field is sent as an empty string

- **WHEN** the operator clears a `text` control
- **THEN** the submitted `data` carries that name with an empty string

#### Scenario: A run waits for its rows' lists

- **WHEN** rows have been edited and their lists have not come back
- **THEN** the run is blocked until they do

#### Scenario: The mapping palette offers every branch's names

- **WHEN** a Connect mapping is built for a template whose branches read `{subtitle}` and
  `{tracking_url}`
- **THEN** both names are offered, before any row has been selected

#### Scenario: A failed request does not strand the operator

- **WHEN** the request for a fresh list fails
- **THEN** the last list received keeps rendering, the failure is surfaced, and the operator can still
  submit

#### Scenario: A newline typed into a grid cell reaches the request

- **WHEN** the operator edits a cell whose control is `textarea` and presses Shift+Enter between two
  words
- **THEN** the cell's value carries a newline at that point, and the row submits it unaltered

#### Scenario: Enter commits a grid cell rather than breaking the line

- **WHEN** the operator presses Enter while editing a cell whose control is `textarea`
- **THEN** the edit is committed and no newline is inserted

#### Scenario: Escape abandons a grid cell edit

- **WHEN** the operator types into a cell whose control is `textarea` and presses Escape
- **THEN** the cell holds the value it held before the edit

#### Scenario: A cell holding a newline is distinguishable from one holding a space

- **WHEN** one row's `message` holds `line one`, a newline, then `line two`, and another row's holds
  `line one line two`
- **THEN** the two cells render differently, and the first shows that its value continues past what
  the cell displays

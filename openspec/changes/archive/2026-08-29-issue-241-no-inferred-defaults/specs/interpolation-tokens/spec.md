## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: A token names one value and may attach one format

*This requirement supersedes, in `docs/SPEC.md` §8 ("Data binding"), the "Token types and precedence"
list, the opening `value` bullet's clause "Tokens are resolved in precedence order, then `{{` and `}}`
emit literal braces", and the closing paragraphs on `now` capture, on `422 MissingField`, and on JSON
scalar stringification. It restates their complete post-change contract. What survives untouched in §8
is the `image` binding bullet, the statement that interpolation applies to text and QR content, and the
substitution-only rule. It also supersedes the sentence in the `datetime_formats` entry of
`docs/SPEC.md`'s unnumbered `Settings` section (`docs/SPEC.md:1036`, the sentence at `:1056`) reading "Used by `{datetime.<name>}` interpolation (see §8)": the setting is
unchanged, the spelling that reaches it is `{sys.now:<name>}` and `{<datetime-param>:<name>}`.*

Interpolation stays substitution-only (ADR-0010, ADR-0055). There are no operators, no functions, no
chaining and no filter arguments. A token is:

```
token       := "{" value-path [ ":" format-name ] "}"
value-path  := bare-name | root "." key
bare-name   := ^[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+$
root        := "vars" | "sys"
format-name := ^[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+$
```

`{{` and `}}` emit literal braces and are not tokens.

This grammar governs every interpolated string a template carries, which is a `text` item's `value:`, a
`qr` item's `value:`, an `image` item's `src:`, and a parameter's `default:` in `params:`. The same
tokens, the same load-time refusals and the same render-time errors apply to all four.

One restriction is peculiar to a `default:` and holds nowhere else: its `value-path` SHALL be dotted.
A **bare** token in a `default:` SHALL be a load-time refusal naming the parameter and the token. The
sources a default may read are therefore fixed before a request arrives, so a default can never depend
on another parameter, on the request `data` map, or on a second default; there is no resolution order
among defaults and no cycle among them to detect. A `default:` that is not a string carries no token
and is used as written.

A token has exactly one interpretation, decided by its shape, so the service SHALL NOT resolve tokens
in a precedence order and SHALL NOT try one source and fall through to another when it does not match.
This replaces the four-level precedence list the frozen §8 defines.

- A **bare** `value-path` names a request value: the parameter of that name if the template declares
  one in `params:`, otherwise a field of the request `data` map. A declared parameter SHALL be resolved
  as that parameter, including its declared `default`, and the `data` map supplies its value rather
  than shadowing it.
- A **dotted** `value-path` names a value under a namespace root, per the requirement below.

A resolved value that is a JSON scalar SHALL be stringified: strings as-is, numbers and booleans via
their textual form, `null` as the empty string, and any other JSON value via its JSON text.

A value that is absent when the label renders SHALL be `422 MissingField` naming the token's
`value-path`.

A `default:` is the one exception, and it covers **every** failure raised while resolving one, not only
an absent value: an absent `{vars.<key>}`, an unknown format name, and any other error this capability
would otherwise report as the caller's. What such a failure reports is decided by the `param-resolution`
capability, because the caller supplied nothing and has nothing to correct. Where a requirement of this
capability names `422 MissingField` for one of those failures, it is superseded for a `default:` alone and
unchanged everywhere else.

Brace syntax errors in a `text` item's `value:`, a `qr` item's `value:` and an `image` item's `src:` are
unchanged by this capability: an unterminated `{` or an unmatched `}` SHALL be `400 InvalidRequest` with
`details.reason` `interpolation_syntax`, raised when the label renders.

In a `default:` the same malformed sequence SHALL be refused **when the template loads**, naming the
parameter. A literal brace in a default is still written `{{` or `}}`; what differs is when the service
says so. Three reasons, and the first is decisive: a default is not interpolated today, so this failure
is *new*, and surfacing a new failure at render would report text only a template author wrote as the
caller's `400 InvalidRequest` against a request that supplied nothing. Second, a default's braces are as
fixed at load as its tokens are, so nothing is lost by deciding them there. Third, refusing at load stops
a template being saved that can never render.

This check SHALL scan a `default:` for well-formed tokens and apply the render path's brace-balance rule
to the text **between** them, which is exactly what the render path does. It SHALL NOT be the token
scanner alone, which by design skips a malformed brace sequence rather than reporting it, and it SHALL
NOT be that brace-balance rule applied to the whole string, which treats every undoubled `{` as an error
and would refuse a legal `default: "{sys.now}"`. This capability does not extend that reasoning to the
other three sites, whose render-time contract is unchanged and remains an inconsistency it does not
resolve.

Every load-time refusal in this capability is one validation rule, reached by two paths. When a template
file is read from disk at startup or reload, the file is quarantined and the service still starts. When
the same content arrives through a template write (`POST`/`PUT`), the write SHALL be refused with
`422 TemplateInvalid` and `details.reason` `template_validation_failed`, and nothing SHALL be stored, so
an operator cannot save a template the loader would quarantine.

An `image` item's `name:` names a request `data` field directly rather than through a token. It SHALL be
a legal bare name under the same rule that binds every other bare name, so that the field an `image`
binds is always one a `{token}` could also name.

#### Scenario: A template write is refused, not quarantined

- **WHEN** a `PUT` to a template carries `{datetime.long_date}` in a `text` item's `value`
- **THEN** the response is `422 TemplateInvalid` with `details.reason` `template_validation_failed`, and
  the stored template is unchanged

#### Scenario: A bare token resolves a request field

- **WHEN** a template renders `"Asset {id}"` with `data: { "id": "A-1004" }`
- **THEN** the label reads `Asset A-1004`

#### Scenario: A bare token resolves a declared parameter's default

- **WHEN** a template declares `title: { type: string, default: "Untitled" }` and renders `"{title}"`
  with no `title` in the request
- **THEN** the label reads `Untitled`

#### Scenario: A namespaced token in a default is resolved

- **WHEN** a template declares `url: { type: string, default: "{vars.qr_base_url}" }`, the store holds
  `qr_base_url = https://ex.co/`, and the request carries no `url`
- **THEN** the label reads `https://ex.co/`

#### Scenario: A bare token in a default is refused when the template loads

- **WHEN** a template file declares `copy: { type: string, default: "{message}" }`
- **THEN** the file is quarantined with a validation message naming `copy` and `{message}`, and the same
  content arriving through a `PUT` is refused with `422 TemplateInvalid`

#### Scenario: A literal brace in a default is escaped like any other

- **WHEN** a template declares `label: { type: string, default: "{{draft}}" }` and the request omits it
- **THEN** the label reads `{draft}`

#### Scenario: An unescaped brace in a default is refused when the template loads

- **WHEN** a template file declares `label: { type: string, default: "50% {off" }`
- **THEN** the file is quarantined with a validation message naming `label`, the same content is refused
  on `PUT` with `422 TemplateInvalid`, and no request ever receives `400 InvalidRequest` for it

#### Scenario: Doubled braces are literal

- **WHEN** a template renders `"{{id}} is {id}"` with `data: { "id": "A-1004" }`
- **THEN** the label reads `{id} is A-1004`

#### Scenario: An image source is interpolated by the same rules

- **WHEN** a template's `image` item carries `src: "logos/{vars.brand}.png"` and the store holds
  `brand = acme`
- **THEN** the asset `logos/acme.png` is resolved
- **AND** the same item carrying `src: "logos/{datetime.brand}.png"` fails validation at load, naming
  `datetime` as an unknown source

#### Scenario: An absent field fails when the label renders

- **WHEN** a template renders `"{id}"` and the request carries no `id`
- **THEN** the response is `422 MissingField` naming `id`, and the template itself loaded without error
